Influence positivity âœ¨

I am 27 and should have been coding over 10 years ago. I am seeking to learn how to be more creative
with the use of code. I also hope to make this my full-time career as I do not want to go back working
in the automotive industry. I will be relentless and give it my best.



welcome to my page.


I typed a bunch of stuff earlier not really meaningful shit but stuff that I don't
really feel like going through and thinking of again. For all I know this text
that I am typing could vanish like what I just wrote! I'll end this here.

thanks for reading!
