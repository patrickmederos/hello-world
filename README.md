Influence positivity

I am 27 and should have been coding over 10 years ago. I am seeking to learn how to be more creative
with the use of code. I also hope to make this my full-time career as I do not want to go back working
in the automotive industry. I will be relentless and give it my best.

Thanks for reading!
